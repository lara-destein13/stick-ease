StickEase can be created in the text area located in the composer component and the button handles the transfer of your newly generated StickEase onto your canvas. Each sticky is draggable and resizable and all stickEase are saved to localStorage. Upon opening your browser you will find that each of your created StickEase shows up on your canvas with the same content, size, and positioning as your previous visit.
